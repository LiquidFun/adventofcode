# My Advent of Code Solutions

The solutions are meant to be ran with the `program-tester.sh` script (see [here](https://github.com/LiquidFun/misc-scripts)), which runs the program on all `*.in` files in the directory, and tests whether the corresponding `*.ans` file matches the given output. As of 2021, each program outputs both part 1 and part 2 on separate lines.

Programs are initialized with the `init-day.sh` script. I.e. typing `init-day.sh 10` initializes the 10th day by creating a folder named `10`, downloading the input test case with the `session.cookie`, copying the `dummy.py` file and opening the solution file.

* 2021: A mix of Julia, Python and APL in that order. Trying out Julia and APL for the first time.
